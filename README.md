# Secret-Hitler-Card-Game-Tracker
A spreadsheet for card counting in the board game "Secret Hitler"
I've included both light mode and dark mode versions of my spreadsheet. Download the .xlsx file that you prefer to have. I don't really use GitHub, and I have no idea what the zip file or tar.gz file is/does, it was automatically created when I uploaded my spreadsheets to GitHub. I recommend when using the spreadsheet, create a copy of the template worksheet every time you use it to record a game. Otherwise, you would need to come back here and download it every time you play a game. To duplicate a worksheet, right-click the tab named "Template" in the lower-left hand corner, click "Move or Copy", check the "Create a copy" box, then press OK. Refer to the image below for help with duplicating worksheets.
